    "Data analytics is the process of using data to gain insights into business decisions. This process is independent of software. In fact, we can learn this process with pencil and paper! In this chapter, you will learn how to reason through data analyses without using software. As you become more comfortable with this type of reasoning, you will apply it to writing SQL statements. Eventually, you will apply this reasoning process in Excel. Once you become adept at this process, you will find that you think before you act with data, and this will make you a powerful data analyst.\n",

    "A computer program is simply a set of instructions for a computer. When you write a computer program, your code is translated into instructions that the computer can understand. Programs are written in a programming language. There are many programming languages out there and each is a different way of telling a computer what to do. Over the years, programmers have created different languages, each with its advantages and disadvantages, and as a result these languages tend to evolve for different use cases. For example, PHP and JavaScript are frequently used to create websites, while C++ is often used to create games. SQL was originally developed at IBM as a way to manipulate and retrieve data stored in a relational database.<sup>\\[1\\]</sup> It is now one of the most popular programming languages worldwide."
