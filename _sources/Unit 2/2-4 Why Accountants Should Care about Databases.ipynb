Understanding databases moves you from simply being a user of accounting software to a professional who understands the structure and flow of the data itself."

    "Think of the old, green-paged ledgers. Today, that ledger is a database. All major accounting and business management software - from QuickBooks for small businesses to massive enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems like SAP, Oracle, and NetSuite for large corporationsâ€”are built on databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems integrate information from all parts of a business (sales, inventory, human resources) into a central database. As an accountant, you interact with an application's interface, but the *single source of truth* is the database. Understanding how that database is structured helps you grasp how a sales transaction in one department correctly impacts the financial statements you're responsible for."

For example, they could write a query to find invoices approved after midnight, payments made to vendors with employee-matching addresses, or duplicate invoice numbers.\n",

    "* **Testing Controls**: IT auditors specifically assess the controls within the database itself, such as user access rights and data validation rules, to ensure data integrity is maintained at its source."
